## Your Privacy

Last updated and effective: October 16, 2021.

This privacy policy applies to the Discord bot application **Elixir#1902** (`@838118537276031006`), referred to as "Elixir", the "Ponjo Team", "us", or "we".

### About Your Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. Our policy is to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our websites, services, and utilities. The Privacy Policies for each of our services, that of Elixir outlined below, provide a more detailed explanation of what data we store for each of our services, how long it is retained, how you can request for your data to be deleted, and more.

Elixir & the Ponjo Team stand firmly beside [Discord's privacy policy.](https://discord.com/privacy)

By default, Elixir stores little data on its own. Elixir stores primarily guild IDs in order to manage the music queue of each guild individually. Each guild ID is encrypted. In addition, Elixir also stores history of some songs that have been played in a guild in order to best suit the autoplay feature for that guild. For example, if members of a particular guild have played lots of Queen songs, this data would be used to suggest more songs similar to Queen songs within the autoplay feature of the bot. Elixir no longer stores any data with respect to its users.

It is important to note that this data is only stored as it is required for the bot to properly function. The data is not stored with anyone else and remains confidential, and is all safely secured in a database on an OVHCloud server.

### About the Data We Store

All data stored by Elixir is exclusively secured within our United States servers. While some of our other services use servers across the globe, data stored by Elixir is restricted to the United States. All data is secured and regularly backed up for privacy and to provide the best experience for users of the bot. All data stored by any of our services is encrypted.

### More Regarding Data Retention & Deletion

If you would like to submit a data access request in order to view all information Elixir has stored with respect to you, the user, you can do so by sending an email to Ben Petrillo, the bot's developer, at [benpetrillo@ponjo.club](mailto:benpetrillo@ponjo.club) or by contacting an administrator in our [Discord server.](https://ponjo.club/discord)

If you would like to request deletion of your data, you can do so by following the same procedure(s) as specified above.

It is important for you, the user, to know that we only retain data for as long as deemed necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Upon identity verification that it is indeed you, the user, who is requesting to have your data deleted, we will proceed with the process and all data we store with respect to you, will be deleted promptly.
