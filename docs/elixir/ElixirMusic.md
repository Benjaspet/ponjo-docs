# Elixir Music

## Features

- Elixir makes it possible to listen to your favorite tunes with all of your friends, with pristine quality indistinguishable from the original soundtrack. With over 30 commands, you'll be able to easily listen to all your favorite tunes, and then some. Elixir makes it easy to add songs or remove songs from your queue. You can also play songs and playlist from other popular applications, including but not limited to Spotify, SoundCloud, and more.
- Elixir is developed to allow you to play all of your favorite songs with ease, and to get it fully up and running in your Discord server in no time at all. Enjoy music with your friends, and meet new people with similar tastes. Elixir is highly configurable, allowing you to set DJ roles and even prevent duplicate songs from playing.
- With Elixir, all members of your server will be able to listen to their favorite tunes. If more members are listening to music in voice channels, they are more likely to remain in and become more involved in your community. Elixir makes it easy to enjoy listening to your favorite music with a group of friends or by yourself. What's not to love?
