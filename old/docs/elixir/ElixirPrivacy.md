## Your Privacy

Last updated and effective: February 6, 2022

This privacy policy applies to the Discord bot applications **Elixir#1902** and **Elixir Premium#0774**, referred to as "Elixir", the "Ponjo Team", "us", or "we".

### About Your Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. Our policy is to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our websites, services, and utilities. The Privacy Policies for each of our services provide a more detailed explanation of what data we store for each of our services, how long it is retained, how you can request for your data to be deleted, and more.

#### What Data We Collect

By default, Elixir stores little data on its own. All data Elixir stores is as follows:

- Custom Playlist Data
    - Playlist Author
    - Playlist Name, Description, and Cover Image
    - Playlist Tracks
    - Playlist Settings (Shuffle, Repeat, etc.)

Elixir stores guild IDs, which are hashed, in order to manage the music queue of each individual guild.

With respect to raw playlist data, Elixir stores the user ID of the author of the playlist, the name of the playlist, which is hashed to protect privacy.

It is important to note that this data is only stored as it is required for particular features of the bot to properly function. The data is not stored with anyone else and remains confidential and secured.

### About the Data We Store

All data stored by Elixir is exclusively secured within our Canada servers. While some of our other services use servers across the globe, data stored by Elixir is restricted to Canada. All data is secured and regularly backed up for privacy and to provide the best experience for users of the bot. All data stored by any of our services is encoded.

If you would like to request deletion of your data, you can do so by following the same procedure(s) as specified above.

We only retain data for as long as deemed necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Upon identity verification that it is indeed you, the user, who is requesting to have your data deleted, we will proceed with the process and your data will be purged promptly.

### Disclosure of Your Data
